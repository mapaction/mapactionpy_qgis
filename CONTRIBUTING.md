The MapAction Controller can be installed for QGIS using these instructions. Once this is done, the controller can be used to generate a JSON set of instructions for a map product, including:

* Layer lists and locations
* Style references
* Template references

# Interface with the Controller

Much of the general functionality for finding and checking the available data and then producing maps is provided by the `mapactionpy_controller` module.

The priciple interface for plugins is to subclass `BaseRunnerPlugin` and providing implenmentations of the various methods which raise `NotImplementedError`:
https://github.com/mapaction/mapactionpy_controller/blob/master/mapactionpy_controller/plugin_base.py

The key method `build_project_files`. The controller will pass a parameter kwargs['state'] which is a MapRecipe object. At the point this object resembles this [example json representation](mapactionpy_qgis/tests/example_files/MA9001-v16-example-overview-map-post-controller.json). The method should perform all most of the functions delegated to the plugin.

The de-facto reference implenmentation is the [`mapactionpy_arcmap`](https://github.com/mapaction/mapactionpy_controller) module.

Whilst, in theory, it would be possible to produce a basic plugin by "just" subclassing `BaseRunnerPlugin`, a more thorough implenmentaion may also make changes to the controller module and its workflow itself.

# Tasks delegated to the plugin

The remaining development in QGIS needs to be build a component which will be able to take the [recipe object above](mapactionpy_qgis/tests/example_files/MA9001-v16-example-overview-map-post-controller.json) this specification and turn it into a QGIS project, or series of projects, which reference the source data and the files, and include appropriate Print Layouts. Weâ€™ll need components which:

* Creates a new QGIS project
* Load the referenced data
* Apply the appropriate styles
* Create Print Layouts
* Set the QGIS variables which populate the template marginalia
* Export the Print Layouts for along with relevant metadata for onward distribution.

The result will be module which uses the QGIS Python API to drive this production pipeline. It does not need to be a plugin for QGIS itself. There is scope to explore whether there is potential functional overlap with [`mapexport-qgis3`](https://github.com/mapaction/mapexport-qgis3). "mapexport-qgis3" is an interactive QGIS plugin that exports maps, data and their metadata in a manner ready for [import into CKAN](https://github.com/aptivate/ckanext-mapactionimporter). In particular it would be valuable to explore potential code-sharing/re-use between the projects.

Non-programming tasks required to support this development:

* Conversion of Arc Layer files to QML (probably using SLYR)
* QGIS Templates in line with Arc Templates (using QGIS Template scripts)
